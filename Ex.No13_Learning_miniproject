### REGISTER NUMBER : 212223040120

### AIM: 
To train a supervised learning model using Random Forest Regressor to predict medical insurance charges based on patient details.

###  Algorithm:
1. Import necessary libraries such as pandas, sklearn, numpy and matplotlib.

2. Load the dataset and explore the structure using head() and info().

3. Visualize the data using suitable graphs to understand relationships.

4. Convert categorical data into numerical form using one-hot encoding.

5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

6. Create the Random Forest Regressor model and train it with training data.

7. Predict medical charges for test data and evaluate performance using RMSE and R² score.

8. Plot Actual vs Predicted graph and residual plot.

9. Display feature importance values.

### Program:
```
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
import numpy as np

# NEW LIBRARIES FOR GRAPHING
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
```
# The file path is just the name of the file you uploaded
file_path = '/content/insurance.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Print the first 5 rows
print("--- Data Head ---")
print(df.head())

# Print a summary to check data types
print("\n--- Data Info ---")
df.info()
```
### Output:




### Output:


### Result:
Thus the system was trained successfully and the prediction was carried out.
